## Appointment Scheduler Project Planning Version 1 

```
I'm building a small business appointment scheduler for local entrepreneurs like barbers, stylists, consultants, or tutors. Please help me plan this application with the following:

1. Key features needed for a minimum viable product (MVP)
2. User stories for both business owners and clients
3. A simple data model for storing:
   - Business information
   - Service offerings
   - Appointments
   - Clients
4. Basic workflow for how the application should function
5. Technical considerations for a frontend using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS
6. Technical considerations for a backend using Python and Supabase

My technical knowledge is beginner-intermediate level with some understanding of Python, HTML, and basic database concepts.

# Small Business Appointment Scheduler Planning
I'll help you plan your appointment scheduler application for local entrepreneurs. This is a practical project with a clear purpose that can provide real value to small business owners.
## 1. Key Features for MVP

- **Notifications:** Email confirmations and reminders for appointments
- **Simple Admin Dashboard:** For business owners to view upcoming appointments
- **Mobile-Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## 2. User Stories
### Business Owner Stories
- As a business owner, I want to create my business profile so clients can find my services
- As a business owner, I want to define my services with prices and duration so clients know what I offer
- As a business owner, I want to set my availability hours so clients can only book when I'm available
- As a business owner, I want to view all upcoming appointments so I can plan my day
- As a business owner, I want to receive notifications when new appointments are booked
- As a business owner, I want to cancel or reschedule appointments when necessary
- As a business owner, I want to view client booking history to better understand my customers

### Client Stories

- As a client, I want to see available time slots so I can book at a convenient time
- As a client, I want to create an account to manage my appointments
- As a client, I want to receive confirmation and reminders about my appointments
- As a client, I want to cancel or reschedule my appointment if needed
- As a client, I want to view my booking history for reference
- As a client, I want to leave feedback after my appointment


## Simple Data Models:
1. Business
2. Services
3. Users
4. clients
5. Appointments

## 4. Basic Workflow
1. **Business Owner Onboarding:**
    - Register as a business owner
    - Create business profile
    - Add services with prices and duration
    - Set availability and business hours

2. **Client Booking Flow:**
    - Browse businesses or access a specific business link
    - Register/login as a client
    - View services offered
    - Select desired service
    - View available time slots
    - Book appointment
    - Receive confirmation

3. **Appointment Management:**
    - Both clients and business owners can view upcoming appointments
    - Either party can cancel or request rescheduling
    - Automated reminders sent before appointment
    - Business owner can mark appointments as completed
    - Optional follow-up for feedback

## 5. Frontend Technical Considerations
### HTML + Alpine.js + TailwindCSS
- **TailwindCSS Setup:**
    - Use a CDN for quick setup initially
    - Later consider using a build process with PostCSS for production
    - Utilize Tailwind's responsive utilities for mobile-first design

- **Alpine.js for Interactivity:**
    - Calendar component for date selection
    - Time slot picker with available/unavailable slots
    - Form validation for user inputs
    - Modal dialogs for confirmations and alerts
    - Tabs for organizing dashboard sections

- **Page Structure:**
    - Landing page with explanation of service
    - Business profile pages
    - Service listing pages
    - Booking form with calendar
    - User account pages (separate for clients and business owners)
    - Dashboard for business owners

- **Responsive Considerations:**
    - Ensure calendar view works well on mobile
    - Simplified navigation for small screens
    - Touch-friendly interface elements

## 6. Backend Technical Considerations
### Python + Supabase
- **Supabase Setup:**
    - Setup authentication (handles logins, signups, password resets)
    - Create database tables based on your data model
    - Set up row-level security policies to protect data
    - Configure email notifications through Supabase or a third-party service

- **Python Backend:**
    - Use a lightweight framework like FastAPI or Flask
    - Create REST API endpoints for:
        - User management
        - Business profile CRUD
        - Service CRUD
        - Appointment booking logic
        - Availability calculations

    - Implement business logic for:
        - Checking availability before booking
        - Preventing double-bookings
        - Managing appointment status changes
        - Sending notifications

- **Integration Points:**
    - Use Supabase JavaScript library on frontend for auth
    - Use Supabase Python library for backend operations
    - Consider serverless functions for scheduled tasks like reminders

- **Security Considerations:**
    - Proper authentication for all API endpoints
    - Data validation and sanitization
    - Separation of business owner vs client permissions

## Getting Started Recommendations
1. Start with setting up Supabase and your database schema
2. Create a simple frontend with the business owner flow
3. Implement the service creation functionality
4. Build the calendar view and booking logic
5. Add client registration and authentication
6. Implement notifications and reminders
7. Polish the UI/UX for both personas
