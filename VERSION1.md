2. **Effective prompts you discovered:** list the 5 principles of effective prompt engineering
##### The Five principles of Effective Prompting are:
1. **Give Direction:** provide a clear direction by describing the desired style in detail ( be descriptive) or reference a relevant persona.
2. **Specify Format:** define what **rules** to follow, and the required **structure** of the response.
3. **Provide Examples:** provide diverse set of use cases or examples where the task was one correctly.
4. **Evaluate Quality:** identity errors on the responses, rate responses, testing what drives performance.
5. **Divide Labor:** split tasks into multiple steps, solve each segment in isolation and finally put together the solutions into one that solve complex big problem.
